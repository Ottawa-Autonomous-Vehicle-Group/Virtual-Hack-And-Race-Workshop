# Virtual Hack and Race Workshop

PaulH will be hosting a workshop to help beginners prepare for the April 25th Global DIY Robocars Hack and Race! 

**Who**: Anyone interested in racing their own virtual autonomous car! We do not assume prior knowledge of Donkey Car, or other platforms.

**Date**: Sunday April 12 3-5pm EST

**Location**: [Zoom meeting](https://docusign.zoom.us/j/562745801?pwd=N3JNRU9xNThaN1BHWTNITUxMUGZtQT09)

# What to do in Advance

## \*\*\*NEW\*\*\*
Tawn has created a new video tutorial on setting up the Donkey car simulator on Windows.  (The steps are very similar for Mac and Linux.)  He has also added a virtual racing page to the Donkey Docs.  These are very highly recommended if you want to get started on the Donkey car simulator.

## Install SW on PC (Windows, Mac, Linux)

We will be using 3 packages that are needed for the autonomous car workflow using a simulator:
1. Donkey Car
2. Gym Donkey Car (Open AI Gym Environment for Donkey Car)
3. Donkey Car Simulator

You will need Python 3 and Git.  An easy way to install these packages is to use miniconda.  This is described in the Donkey Car SW installation below.

### Donkey Car SW
[Install donkey car software](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/install_software/#step-1-install-software-on-host-pc) on your host PC

### Gym Donkey Car

* [Guide for installing simulator](http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/)

### sdsandbox (Self Driving Sandbox) Donkey Car Simulator
[Github for sdsandbox](https://github.com/tawnkramer/sdsandbox).  This is the Unity source for the self driving sandbox simulator.  You will also need to install Unity to build this from source: [Download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

Instead of building from source, executables are also available at: https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar/releases
